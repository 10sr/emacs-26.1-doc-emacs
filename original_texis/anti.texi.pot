"Emacs no longer defaults to requiring the GnuTLS library when you build it.  "
"Those who want the TLS functionality built-in will have to explicitly "
"request it at build time---or forever hold their peace.  We decided that "
"having the TLS functionality doesn't justify annoying users or package "
"builders with error messages about libgnutls absence.  We also decided that "
"if you do build with GnuTLS, we will allow versions of the library older "
"than 2.12.2, as that version will become less and less available/popular as "
"you move farther back in time."
